For details on Titanium, please see <http://titaniumapp.com>.


---------------------
 Build Prerequisites
---------------------

To build Titanium from source, you will need the following prerequisites:

  - Ruby 1.8.6 or greater <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>
  - RubyGems with the following gems: rake, rubyzip

To build Titanium, you will need to first checkout the Appcelerator SDK
from <http://github.com/jhaynie/appcelerator_sdk/tree/master>.

After checkout, set the environment variable 'APPC_SDK' to the root of the SDK directory.

To build Titanium, you will need to checkout a special fork of the Google Gears branch 
from <http://github.com/marshall/gears-titanium/tree/master>. This should be checked 
into the root of the titanium folder using the directory name 'gears-titanium' or into 
another folder with a symlink with this name in the titanium folder.


--------------------
 General Build Info
--------------------

The Titanium build will create Appcelerator compatible distribution files which are
released (or installed) by the Appcelerator CLI.  The distribution files will be built
into the $APPC/stage directory.  Each file will start with titanium-.  For example, the
0.1.0 version of Titanium is named titanium-osx-0.1.0.zip.  

Once built, this file can be locally installed for testing by using the following 
command to install in a command prompt:

	> app install:titanium <file>

For example:

	> app install:titanium $APPC/stage/titanium-osx-0.1.0.zip

* NOTE: You will need to have first installed either the Titanium SDK or the Appcelerator
SDK before attempting to install.  Make sure that you have the appcelerator CLI binary
on your path (should be automatically placed on your path during installation).

You will need to install both a titanium-project and titanium-<os> distribution to 
create and bundle titanium projects. (See below for Titanium project instructions).

Once you have both installed, you can run the following command to create a titanium
project:

	> app create:project . test titanium

The period (.) is the path to create the project.  The 3rd argument (test) is the name 
of the project to create.  Set this to the name of your application.

If everything worked, you should get a number of files in the directory named test.

To test bundling, run the following command (replace with your OS) in your project
directory:

	> app package:project osx

If everything worked, you should have a directory named stage in your project directory
and inside that directory, you should have a folder with your distribution files.
For OSX, the folder will be named test.app (or test will be replaced with whatever you
named your project).


-----------------
 Platform Builds
-----------------

Titanium requires platform-specific builds.  Currently, Titanium builds on Win32 and
Mac OSX.  Linux build is in progress.

Win32
------

You will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 + Service Packs to build Titanium.  This
requirement is for building Chromium.  It *will not* work with any other compiler
version, sorry.  Please first follow setting up your environment to build
chromium by following instructions (to precise detail) at
<http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-windows> 

In the future, we will support building Titanium with a binary release of chromium.

To build the Win32 distribution, type the following in a command prompt:

	> rake titanium:runtime:win32


OSX
----

You will need XCode 3.0+ to build Titanium and it must be built on Leopard.

If you have xcode installed, you should be able to build Titanium with no additional
dependencies.

To build the OSX distribution, type the following in a command prompt:

	> rake titanium:runtime:osx

Linux
------

More details coming soon....

To build the Linux distribution, type the following in a command prompt:

	> rake titanium:runtime:linux


-----------------
 Project Support
-----------------

Titanium has an additional distribution that is required to be built and distributed.
This file is used by the Appcelerator CLI to create Titanium projects or to add
Titanium support to existing Appcelerator projects.  To build this distribution file,
type the following in a command prompt:

	> rake titanium:project
