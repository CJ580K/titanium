---------------------
 Build Prerequisites
---------------------

To build Titanium, you will need to first checkout the Appcelerator SDK
from <http://github.com/jhaynie/appcelerator_sdk/tree/master>.

After checkout, set the environment variable 'APPC_SDK' to the root of the SDK directory.

To build Titanium, you will need to checkout a special fork of the Google Gears branch 
from <http://github.com/marshall/gears-titanium/tree/master>. This should be checked 
into the root of the titanium folder using the directory name 'gears-titanium' or into 
another folder with a symlink with this name in the titanium folder.


-----------------
 Platform Builds
-----------------

Titanium requires platform-specific builds.  Currently, Titanium builds on Win32 and
Mac OSX.  Linux build is in progress.

Win32
------

You will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 + Service Packs to build Titanium.  This
requirement is for building Chromium.  It *will not* work with any other compiler
version, sorry.  Please first follow setting up your environment to build
chromium by following instructions (to precise detail) at
<http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-windows> 

In the future, we will support building Titanium with a binary release of chromium.

OSX
----

You will need XCode 3.0+ to build Titanium and it must be built on Leopard.

If you have xcode installed, you should be able to build Titanium with no additional
dependencies.

Linux
------

Coming soon.
