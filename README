For details on Titanium, please see <http://titaniumapp.com>.

---------------------
 Build Prerequisites
---------------------

To build Titanium from source, you will need the following prerequisites:

  - Python
  - Scons package - <http://www.scons.org/>
  - Platform compiler (see below for each platform)

Python and SCons are used to build Titanium but not required for end-development
or runtime.

To build Titanium, you will need to first checkout the Titanium source code
from <http://github.com/marshall/titanium/tree/master>. 

Currently, we are building Titanium for 32-bit architectures but intend to support 64-bit
very soon. If you have patches or would like to assist, please contact us (see below for
IRC or email information).

-------
 Setup
-------

You will first need to update the kroll submodule that is checked in to Titanium before
you can succesfully build.  You can run the following command from the root source 
directory to update the submodule:

> git submodule update --init

This will pull the contents of the submodule into your local kroll folder.

----------
 Building
----------

Titanium uses SCons for building.  You can run scons by typing:

> scons

To enable a debug build, use the debug flag:

> scons debug=1

To build the packaged bundles, use package flag:

> scons package=1

The output of the build will be in a folder named build\<osname> such as 
build/osx for OSX.


---------------
 Platform Info 
---------------

Titanium requires platform-specific builds.  Currently, Titanium builds on Win32, Linux 
and Mac OSX 10.5.4+.

Win32
------

You will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 + Service Packs to build Titanium. We have
not tested building Titanium on Visual Studio 2008.  You will need to obtain the 
Microsoft Visual Studio Service Pack 1 to compile Titanium.

Win32 Ruby Notes
================

To build Ruby module support you will need to first install Ruby 1.8+ and make sure
it's own your path.  There is a problem with the included Ruby header file named
config.h (under $RUBY\lib\ruby\1.8\i386-mswin32\) that requires you to hand edit
the file to comment out the check.  If you receive the following warning:

fatal error C1189: #error : MSC version unmatch

Then you have experienced this error.  Hand edit the file and comment out the top
of the header file that checks the version and re-compile.

 
OSX
----

You will need XCode 3.0+ to build Titanium and it must be built on Leopard. Titanium
is only supported on Leopard (or later).

If you have xcode installed, you should be able to build Titanium with no additional
dependencies.

Linux
------

Each distribution varies slightly for building Titanium on a Linux distribution.

Ubuntu 8.10 32bit
=================

1. Install the required libraries:

sudo apt-get install build-essential ruby rubygems libzip-ruby scons libxml2-dev libgtk2.0-dev python-dev ruby-dev

2. Install Git:

sudo apt-get install git-core
